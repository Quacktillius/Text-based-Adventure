## Proposal

In this project, we will use the 1981 arcade game, Galaga, as a source of inspiration, and design an arcade shooter.

### Game Description
##### Name: (Not decided)
The fun game mehanics will be the game's main feature, but there will also be a short story-line with a beginning and an end.
##### Mechanics: 

###### Objective: Destroy waves of enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen, and survive by avoiding incoming projectiles.

###### Player
The player will control a ship at the bottom of the screen.
* Can move horizontally
* Can fire
* Can pick up "power-ups" that grant special abilities

###### Enemies
Enemies will randomly appear at the top of the screen and move downwards. There will be distinct classes of enemies and each class will add some nuances to the overall core gameplay loop.
Some enemies will have armor, and will be harder to gun down.
Other enemies will be able to fire 'waves' of projectiles, making it harder for the player to dodge them.
Some enemies might move horizontally too, and shoot.
There will also be 'boss' enemies, with their own set of moves and nuances.
